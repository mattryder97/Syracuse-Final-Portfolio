This is the repository for my final project in IST 687- Intro to Data Science, completed during Fall 2020 with Professor John Santerre.


#### Project Data Cleanup.R
This file was used to read in, and preprocess the data for this project. Can be opened in R or RStudio and utilizes the projectdata.xlsx file.

#### Project TrainTestSplit.R
This file was used to get a training and testing dataset for the models. Can be opened in R or RStudio and should be run after the Rroject Data Cleanup.R file has been run in the local environment.

#### Project NB.R
The file was used to develop a prediction model using the naiveBayes function in the e1071 package in R. Can be opened in R or RStudio and should run after Project TrainTestSplit.R has been run in the local envirnment.

#### Project Random Forest.R
The file was used to develop a prediction model using the randomForest function in the randomForest package in R. Can be opened in R or RStudio and should run after Project TrainTestSplit.R has been run in the local envirnment.

#### Project SVM.R
The file was used to develop a prediction model using the ksvm function in the kernlab package in R. Can be opened in R or RStudio and should run after roject TrainTestSplit.R has been run in the local envirnment.
